# üîå Quattrofy API

## üß≠ Overview  
**Quattrofy API** is a secure, internal RESTful API designed to enable seamless integration between the **Quattrofy Web Application** and tools such as **Microsoft Power Automate**, **Microsoft Copilot Studio**, and future internal systems. It serves as the foundation for data automation, smart queries, and actionable insights across Quattro Constructors' operational environment.

---

## üí° Idea & Concept  
The goal was to build a **centralized API layer** for securely exposing business logic and data from the Quattrofy system.  
It empowers automation, real-time querying, and task execution using tools like Power Automate and conversational agents like QuattroMan.

## ‚ú® Key Endpoints  
Some of the most commonly used and critical endpoints include:

- `/employees/location` ‚Äì Return current or last known location of an employee  
- `/equipment/location` ‚Äì Return last registered project or location for an asset  
- `/projects/summary` ‚Äì Returns general information about project status, start, cost, team, etc.  
- `/projects/payclasses` ‚Äì Retrieves pay class information for a specific project  
- `/projects/sync` ‚Äì Performs secure sync operation between external and Quattrofy databases  
- `/system/ping` ‚Äì Used for availability checks before automated flows run
