# üîå Quattrofy API

## üß≠ Overview  
**Quattrofy API** is a secure, internal RESTful API designed to enable seamless integration between the **Quattrofy Web Application** and tools such as **Microsoft Power Automate**, **Microsoft Copilot Studio**, and future internal systems. It serves as the foundation for data automation, smart queries, and actionable insights across Quattro Constructors' operational environment.

---

## üí° Idea & Concept  
The goal was to build a **centralized API layer** for securely exposing business logic and data from the Quattrofy system.  
It empowers automation, real-time querying, and task execution using tools like Power Automate and conversational agents like QuattroMan.
